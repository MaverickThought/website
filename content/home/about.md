# Biography

I am a PhD student in the Industrial Engineering & Operations Research department at UC Berkeley. My advisor is Prof Candi Yano. My research is currently focused on Inventory Control for multi-generational high-tech products with uncertain warranty obligations. 

In my free time I enjoy watching classic movies and going to baseball games.
