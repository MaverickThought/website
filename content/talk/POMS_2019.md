# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "High-tech products have short life cycles, but relatively long warranty periods that the manufacturer must consider when ending production. We develop an analytical model to optimize the timing and size of the manufacturerâ€™s final production run. The distribution of warranty demand is obtained from an industry-data-inspired forecasting model."
